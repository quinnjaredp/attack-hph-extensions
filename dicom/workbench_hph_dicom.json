Users (e.g., clinicians, technologists, support staff, etc.) may be socially engineered to open or import a file that leads to code execution. This action maybe observed as follow-on behavior from [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001), or delivery via shared repositories and clinical workflows.\n\nHealthcare environments frequently treat clinical files as “known-good”, and carve out exceptions in AV/EDR and content gateways to preserve care delivery (e.g., scan exclusions on PACS drop folders and viewer processes). This implicit trust reduces telemetry and creates blind spots that adversaries can exploit, making sector-specific files an appealing execution vehicle.\n\nAdversaries may use several types of healthcare-specific files that require a user or workflow to open/ingest them, including: DICOM images (.dcm) and study bundles (e.g., DICOMDIR/archives), viewer project/session files, clinical document formats (e.g., C-CDA/FHIR XML/JSON), ECG/waveform formats, HL7 messages (.hl7, often plain-text pipe-delimited), and vendor-proprietary clinical files. Opening or importing these artifacts can exploit file-format quirks (e.g., preambles) or parser vulnerabilities in viewers, PACS clients, or clinical tooling - resulting in memory corruption or code execution. Attackers may employ [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) and [Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027) (e.g., familiar patient/study naming or password-protected archives with “how-to-open” instructions) to increase the likelihood of successful execution.\n\nWhile Malicious Healthcare File may occur shortly after Initial Access, it may also occur at other phases of an intrusion. For example, when an adversary places a crafted study in a shared directory, imaging workstation inbox, or PACS/RIS “watch folder” - hoping that a user or automated import pipeline will open or ingest it.\n\nRecent federal guidance documents hospital-targeted ransomware campaigns that rely on user-initiated execution, underscoring this sub-technique’s relevance to HPH environments (Citation: CISA-FBI-HHS AA20-302A).","kill_chain_phases":[{"kill_chain_name":"mitre-attack","phase_name":"execution"}],"x_mitre_attack_spec_version":"3.3.0","x_mitre_contributors":["QuinnTech"],"x_mitre_deprecated":false,"x_mitre_detection":"Monitor the execution and command-line arguments of clinical applications that require user interaction or automated ingest (e.g., imaging viewers and PACS/RIS/interface-engine utilities).
